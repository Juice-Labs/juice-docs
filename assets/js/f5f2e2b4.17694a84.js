Caching improves load time on inference workloads by caching the model data between runs. Once the model is loaded and inference is being run, caching has no further effect on performance. Up to 16GB of data is cached per concurrent connection and that cached data will be reused for subsequent workloads run against the same server.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"juice/pro-users/cli-app/cli-app":{"id":"juice/pro-users/cli-app/cli-app","title":"Using the CLI App","description":"The command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool designed to facilitate various operations and configurations for users.

The author takes a fairly simplistic workflow that consists of a single small kernel doing minimal work repeatedly applied to a buffer of data. The author starts with a naive implementation that performs a manual synchronization call after each kernel invocation, then refactors to an approach with synchronization calls only performed after a batch of kernels are executed. Finally, they introduce the graph API which allows for CUDA calls to be recorded and replayed with a single function invocation. These approaches, as well as another improvement are diagrammed in figure 1.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"juice/pro-users/performance-latency/example-workloads":{"id":"juice/pro-users/performance-latency/example-workloads","title":"Example Workloads","description":"In addition to hand-rolled CUDA code, juice supports third party frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
