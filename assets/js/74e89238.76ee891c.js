Natively, CUDA does the same thing, however for juice, since the latency is variable and dependent on network performance, this stall can take a longer time to resolve. We need to wait for the device to flush and synchronize itself alongside whatever subtle latency is introduced by the chatter between server and client. E.g. on a 70ms latent connection, a naively placed cudaStreamSynchronize is effectively a 70ms sleep. If the GPU operation extends beyond this 70ms, the performance impact won\u2019t be noticeable. When the GPU is not sufficiently saturated this call will become a bottleneck."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This overhead is neatly addressed (locally and remotely) through the graph API which takes those thousand kernel launches and wraps them into one invocation that allows juice to make fewer round trip calls to the server.

Assume that we need to complete eight independent tasks of the workload from the article and that we have sufficient memory to store all runs together.

Once enough work is queued onto a stream we can query the events and queue new batches as the old ones complete. The advantage of this system is that the GPU can continue to do meaningful work while the CPU manages task state. Extending our reference code from the previous example to interleave eight jobs (listing 2) we observe an execution time of 27.78 seconds natively and 28.16 seconds with juice. This corresponds to a slowdown of only 1.4%. Additionally, both runtimes complete in less time than it would take to simply run the workflow eight times. This concept could (and likely should) be extended to a dynamic pool that can dispatch enough work to saturate the GPU while keeping the memory footprint manageable."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(t.img,{alt:"Latency Example",src:n(4302).A+"",width:"610",height:"305"})})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},4302:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{A:()=>a});const a=n.p+"assets/images/latency_example-d3133d0687a17d80435d7032c05482ff.png"},8453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>s});var a=n(6540);const i={},o=a.createContext(i);function r(e){const t=a.useContext(o);return a.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function s(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:r(e.components),a.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
