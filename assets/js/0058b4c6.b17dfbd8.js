The author takes a fairly simplistic workflow that consists of a single small kernel doing minimal work repeatedly applied to a buffer of data. The author starts with a naive implementation that performs a manual synchronization call after each kernel invocation, then refactors to an approach with synchronization calls only performed after a batch of kernels are executed. Finally, they introduce the graph API which allows for CUDA calls to be recorded and replayed with a single function invocation. These approaches, as well as another improvement are diagrammed in figure 1.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"juice/user-guide/performance-latency/example-workloads":{"id":"juice/user-guide/performance-latency/example-workloads","title":"Example Workloads","description":"In addition to hand-rolled CUDA code, juice supports third party frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
