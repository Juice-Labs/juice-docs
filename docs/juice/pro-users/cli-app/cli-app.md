# Using the CLI App 

The command-line interface (CLI) is a command line/terminal tool designed to facilitate various operations and configurations for users. You can run commands to help manage configurations, contexts, agents, pools, organizations, sessions, runs, users, and authentication processes.

:::note
Example commands are formatted for Linux machines. For Windows commands, substitute ./boost for either boost.exe or boost.
::: 


Get in-context help by appending –-help or -h to any command.  

**Example**:

```powershell
./boost –h gives you top-level help; ./boost session –h gives you help with sessions. 
```
For more information on the CLI application's capabilities, see the guides on [Advanced CLI Processes](/docs/juice/pro-users/cli-app/advanced-cli/advanced-cli.md).
