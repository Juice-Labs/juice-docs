# Using the CLI App 

The command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool designed to facilitate various operations and configurations for users. You can run commands to help manage:

- Configurations and contexts
- Agents and pools
- Organizations and users
- Sessions and runs
- Authentication processes

## Getting Started

Get in-context help by appending `--help` or `-h` to any command:

```powershell
juice --help          # Top-level help
juice session --help  # Help with sessions
juice run --help      # Help with running applications
```

:::note
Example commands are formatted for Linux machines. For Windows commands, substitute `./juice` for either `juice.exe` or `juice`.
