# Connecting Your GPUs

Juice Desktop will show no available GPUs or sessions to join the first time you start the application, unless you are invited to join an existing pool. To start a session, you’ll need to connect your machine’s available GPUs.

To connect your GPU(s):

1.  Select **Connect GPU** in Sidebar Navigation.
2.  Click **Pools**, then select the pools you want to leverage from the dropdown.

3.  Select the GPU(s) you want to connect to by clicking on the `+` icon. The number displayed tells you how many GPUs you’re leveraging from the selected agents.

Selecting filters lets you specify the number of available GPUs in each agent and how much memory each GPU has, making it much easier to search for available GPUs.
