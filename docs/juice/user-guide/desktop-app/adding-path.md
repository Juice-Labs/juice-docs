# Adding a Path

To run an application from the Juice desktop application on the client side, first configure it by adding its path to the **Connect GPU** section. The Juice desktop application will bridge the remote GPU into any application path you specify.

:::info Example
If the path `C:\AI` is added to the **Connect GPU** section, any application that launches from that folder or its subfolders will leverage the connected remote GPU.
