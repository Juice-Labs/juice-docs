# Welcome to Juice

Juice enables AI and Graphics workloads to run on remote GPUs, making high-performance computing accessible and efficient for everyone.

Our innovative software seamlessly enables offloading of GPU processing for any CUDA or Vulkan application to a remote host that's running our agent. We inject our CUDA and Vulkan implementations during runtime, which means no code changes to your applications - just connect and start accelerating your workloads immediately.

Our advanced virtualization technology supports various "manyness" scenarios, giving you unprecedented flexibility in GPU resource management:
- Connect a single client to multiple GPUs for high-performance parallel computing
- Share a single GPU among multiple clients for optimal resource utilization
- Scale your GPU resources up or down based on your needs
