# Welcome to Juice

Juice enables AI and Graphics workloads to run on remote GPUs.

Our software enables offloading of GPU processing for any CUDA or Vulkan application to a remote host that's running our agent. We inject our CUDA and Vulkan implementations during runtime, which means no code changes to applications.

Our virtualization supports various "manyness" scenarios - e.g. we allow a single client to connect to multiple GPUs or multiple clients to share a single GPU.
