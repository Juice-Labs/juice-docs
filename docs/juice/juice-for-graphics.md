# Juice for Graphics

These examples assume that you are running from a command prompt or shell with the `juice` executable available in the path, e.g. with the directory you extracted the Juice client archive to listed in the `PATH` environment variable.

The graphics examples must be run on Windows, Juice doesn't currently support graphics workloads from Linux clients.  This is a client-side restriction only -- The Juice server runs equally well on Windows and Linux and clients from either operating system can connect to servers running on either operating system.
