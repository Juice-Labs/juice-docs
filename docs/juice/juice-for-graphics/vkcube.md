## vkcube

A good test that everything is working is to run the vkcube example included with the client software.  From a command prompt in the directory that you extracted the client archive to:

~~~
juice run vkcube
~~~

As graphical applications are running, you should see the Juice heads-up-display in the upper left corner of the window.  You're experiencing Juice GPU-over-IP!  Try running multiple clients to the same server - shared GPU is also a unique capability of Juice.
