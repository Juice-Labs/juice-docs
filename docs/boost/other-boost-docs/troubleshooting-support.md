# Troubleshooting and Support

Boost has built-in support features to help you get back to what matters most – your productivity.

- **Guides** links you to HP’s Boost online [user guides](/docs/boost/intro.md).

- **Report Issue** takes you to a form you can complete to report a bug or performance issues to the Support team.

- **Feedback or Idea** lets you submit feedback on your experience with Boost directly to HP.

- **Run Guide Tutorial** triggers the virtual tour that appears when you first open the application.
