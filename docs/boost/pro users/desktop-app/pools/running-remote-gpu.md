# Running an Application on a Remote GPU

While your system is connected to a remote GPU, any application that has its path listed in the Applications tab will run via the remote GPU instead of any local GPU.  

#### To run an application with a Remote GPU: 

1. Expand the selected application while running applications via remote GPU.

2. From the Remote Resources tab, navigate to ***Paths***.

3. Expand ***Paths in Use*** to reveal real-time performance metrics for the selected application.
