# Support

As an admin user, you have a few options to contact support for HP’s Boost that standard users don’t have access to.

### To get support:

1. Click on the ***Support*** tab. A popup will appear with two options:

    - **Guides**: Links to the online Boost User Guides and Support Documentation
    - **Feedback or Idea**: An in-app form that lets you give feedback, share ideas, and more with the HP Boost team.

    - **Report Issue**: An in-app form that lets you report bugs.
